# Problem 12: Highly divisible triangular number

## Problem Description

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

1: 1

3: 1, 3

6: 1, 2, 3, 6

10: 1, 2, 5, 10

15: 1, 3, 5, 15

21: 1, 3, 7, 21

28: 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28

We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors. What is the value of the first triangle number to have over `n` divisors?

## Solution

#### Step 1: Generate Triangle Numbers

* Start with k = 1.
* For each k, the triangle number is  $$T_k = k(k+1)/2$$.

***

#### Step 2: Split for Easier Factorization

Because **k and k+1 are always coprime**, we split the triangle number into two parts:

| If k is... | Split as                           | Example for k        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **even**   | $$T_k = \frac{k}{2} \times (k+1)$$ | $$T_8 = 4 \times 9$$ |
| **odd**    | (T\_k = k \times \frac{k+1}{2})    | (T\_7 = 7 \times 4)  |

***

#### Step 3: Prime Factorization and "Union"

Factorize both parts **separately** (they are coprime).

* Express each part as a dictionary: `{prime: exponent}`
* **Combine (union):**
  * For each unique prime, if it appears in both, sum their exponents.

**Example 1: (T\_7 = 7 \times 4 = 28)**

| Part      | Value | Factorization | As Dict |
| --------- | ----- | ------------- | ------- |
| (k)       | 7     | (7^1)         | {7: 1}  |
| ((k+1)/2) | 4     | (2^2)         | {2: 2}  |

* **Union:** `{7: 1} ∪ {2: 2} = {2: 2, 7: 1}`

**Example 2: (T\_8 = 4 \times 9 = 36)**

| Part  | Value | Factorization | As Dict |
| ----- | ----- | ------------- | ------- |
| (k/2) | 4     | (2^2)         | {2: 2}  |
| (k+1) | 9     | (3^2)         | {3: 2}  |

* **Union:** `{2: 2} ∪ {3: 2} = {2: 2, 3: 2}`

***

#### Step 4: Count Divisors

Given a factorization: \[ N = p\_1^{e\_1} p\_2^{e\_2} \cdots p\_m^{e\_m} ] the number of divisors is: \[ d(N) = (e\_1 + 1)(e\_2 + 1)\cdots(e\_m + 1) ]

**Example**

* For (28 = 2^2 \times 7^1): (d(28) = (2+1) \times (1+1) = 6)
* For (36 = 2^2 \times 3^2): (d(36) = (2+1) \times (2+1) = 9)
